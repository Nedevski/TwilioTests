# TwilioTests

A simple .NET 6 project that tests Twilio's Voice and SMS APIs, using Twilio .NET SDK.

There are an incoming and outgoing call controllers with simple flows - user input, audio playback, recording of part of the call, etc.
There is also the SMS logic, which is not that complicated anyway.
